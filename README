A project to test limits of calling a service many many times at once using async/await.

The project stems from this problem:
I need to call a service several thousands times at once to calculate something, basically a batch. It is not possible to modify the service contract, although it is possible to increase the calls per second.

Now I either use>
* Message Queue to call the service 
* Synchronous service (SOAP)

The MQ is obviously superior way, however I can either choose MQ or synchronous service and I need to to call the service during some requests and MQ is quite a pain in the ass to use for getting an answer during request.

In the end, I will probably choose MQ, but it is nice to check how WCF handles a large load of requests at once.
